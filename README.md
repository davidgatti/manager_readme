# Manager Readme

## What is this?

This document introduces me to anyone who will work with me. We will read this document together and discuss it as we go through it.

## About My Job

I am your manager, and my job is to support you in accomplishing our team's goals. In addition, I am here to help with any obstacles you may encounter and provide guidance and feedback along the way. 

## About Me

I'm very observant of human emotion, facial expression, and body language, and I will use these skills to understand your honesty or the emotional problems you might be facing and create a more welcoming atmosphere to help you voice your concerns. Also, I'm not too fond of hypocrisy.

## Work Style

While we develop new things, I encourage making mistakes, learning from them, experimenting, and having fun. But I expect cold blood and seriousness when the situation calls for it.

## Feedback (how to give & how you give)

I love to give positive feedback when I see good work being done, and I'm not afraid of pointing out when I don't like something, but when I do, I always explain what I don't like. I want to give you a chance to grow and get better. I know it is hard, but I welcome you to do the same for me. This way, we can have an excellent feedback loop and help each other improve.

## How to use my calendar

My calendar follows the FIFO rule, first in, first out. So if you see free space, it is for you to grab. The critical rule is that you list points you want to discuss in the calendar event. Events that lack this list will be canceled.

## What do I pay attention to

Regarding performance reviews, I pay attention to how fast you understand problems, how quickly you can come up with solutions, and how fast you can perform the work. However, I also pay attention if you negatively affect the team. I have zero tolerance for drama and people that like to cause problems instead of solving them.

## D.R.I. Principle

I believe in the Directly Responsible Individual principle and hope you are too. This means that I expect you to take full ownership of your work and hold yourself accountable for its success or failure. I will provide guidance and support, but you are ultimately responsible for your work.
